Built in 2000, the Grandview is regarded as one of the most prestigious luxury condo developments in Calgary. Topped with a striking copper roof, this 16-storey building is a subtle blend of modern and heritage elements right on the edge of the peaceful Elbow River in Mission. Residents enjoy a quiet riverside setting just minutes from downtown, grocery stores, theatres, Elbow Park, cafes, restaurants, bookstores and all the city has to offer.

The Grandview's 56 spacious units feature high ceilings, central air conditioning, tinted windows, security wiring, wide entry doors, expansive bay windows and large private balconies. Many suites enjoy two separate balconies and some have as many as five. The two penthouse suites in the building sport gorgeous glass sunrooms and decks with unsurpassed views of the Elbow River Valley and downtown Calgary.
