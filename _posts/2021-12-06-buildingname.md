#### **Our Story**

Connelly & Company Management LTD. provides property management services in Calgary and surrounding area.

We were formed and became active in October 1980 by Al and Colleen Connelly. For 39 years they ran the company together. Sadly, Al passed away in 2020. The company is now management by his son Marty Connelly.

#### **Our Philosophy**

At Connelly & Company our philosophy is simple:

Give our clients the best service and advice based on our experience in the business so they can make the best decisions possible for their community.

#### **Experience**

Throughout the years Connelly & Company has managed buildings of all types and sizes in Calgary, Strathmore, High River, Cochrane and even Maui.

We have experience running condominiums with many different amenities; Indoor Swimming Pool/Sauna,Theatres, Guest Suites, Banquet/Games/Recreational Rooms, just to name a few – and can assist with bookings, maintenance and collection of fees of facilities, if required.

At Connelly & Company we take a forward thinking and proactive outlook on condominium management. With regular site visits, in depth manager reports and proactive quoting.

We assist our boards in getting the right information, great prices and quality trades work.

We are able to host and attend meetings online. We are also able to bring in board members who may be out of town, live outside of the city or for whatever reason can’t be in the meeting in person.

Connelly & Company provides custom build portal pages for buildings who request this service. The portals give The Board, Owners and even Tenants access to the most pertinent information in just a few clicks.

We pride ourselves in having as many different options for our clients to reach us, and their board, as well as, pay fees. Property managers and staff can be reached by phone or email during regular business hours. We have a 24 hour emergency service for after hours calls and emergencies.

#### **Invoicing**

Connelly & Company adheres to a strict 5 step process when approving your buildings invoices:

1. Our office assistants receive all invoices in the mail and carefully stamp and code each invoice and distributes these to the corresponding property managers
2. The property manager will then review and approve each invoice
3. Our accounting department meticulously inputs invoices into our accounting software (Yardi)
4. Our controller prints checks for each invoice and reviews each check to ensure the proper information is input on the check
5. Marty Connelly reviews and signs each check before they go out in the mail

#### **Financial Statements**

Our financial statements are some of the most in depth statements you will find in our industry. Depending on the size of your building the statements can be up to 11 pages of detail. We have included a sample of these statements below.

#### **Connelly Quality Assurance**

At Connelly & Company we strive to bring our customers the highest quality of service possible. Our job is to ensure our customers are happy with the service they receive from trades as well as our company as a whole. Connelly & Company has policies and quality assurance checks in place that are taught to employees from day one of training and are updated as needed, to be within line of Rules & Regulations at all levels. We pride ourselves on staying on top of local, provincial and national legislation.

#### **Trades Quality Assurance**

Your property manager will ensure jobs are completed and the board is happy before paying the trades people on all major jobs. Our preferred trades know we hold them to certain standards and that we require these standards to be completed before jobs are paid out. Connelly & Company will only recommend contractors with proper Insurance and Liability coverage, and will only recommend companies that other Property Managers within Connelly have used and trust.

Connelly has comprised a preferred trades list amongst our staff that are the trusted trades, in all aspects of a complex, from landscaping, cleaning, electrical work etc. This Trades list has become quite an asset to all Managers in the office. With that being said, we are also open and willing to work with trades that Condominiums prefer working with. We have taken over management of many properties and have built relationships with those trades we have been introduced to through new relationships.
